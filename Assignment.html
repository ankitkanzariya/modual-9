    <p id="q">What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</p>
    <p>ANS:        Bootstrap offers many advantages for web designers and developers, such as saving time and effort by providing ready-made components and styles that can be customized and combined. It also ensures consistency and compatibility, as it follows a standard design and coding convention, and uses a mobile-first approach.

    <p id="q">What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work</p>
    <p>ANS: Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container
